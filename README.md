The Cusp of Application:

   I suspect this audience will mostly agree, and with more reason than I have,
that Zcash is uniquely positioned to provide the first disruptive applications 
of cryptocurrency to the wider network.  An example of the kind of application
I have in mind is the "z-board" POC.
   I'll assume you agree, and I'll also assume that you therefore believe now
is a critical moment for the development of robust, and consistent protocols
on which to base the development of these applications.
   What's the right step in this direction?
   Building off the work which has already been done [ZIP 302] the encrypted
memo working group sought to answer the following questions:

   * How much of the format shall be enforced by zcash-cli/zcashd?
   * Shall there be a standard service that provides the remaining format
       enforcement?
   * How do the current consumers of the memo field behave?
   * What are sufficient set of verifications:
